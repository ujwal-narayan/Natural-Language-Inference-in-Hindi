I.Verb frames

(1)Statistics
(i)Total verbs (Same verb having different senses is also considered different verb)
-Verbs that have frames
-Verbs that are generated

(ii)Total frames
-Frames that are created
-Verbs which are listed under theses frames

(2)Analysis

(i)list verbs which have same frames
(ii)look at syntax of verbs having same meanings
(iii)Types of verbs
(iv)Levin's verbs

(3)Description
-Frame description

desirable (d): -Implicit args--> k3
               -args without which sentence sounds odd when u try to drop it though meaning is conveyed-->baaDZa se wAlAba meM pAnI caDZawA hE
               -low expectation level (mandatory high expectation level)
               -Surface level abscent
               -In past tense it can be dropped and sentence will be perfect whereas in habitual if u drop it sounds odd
	       -Most frequent in text
               -Some arg are expected on surface level and some not: vaha sar para dupatta odhati hai vs vaha badan par razaai odhatii hai
                                                                      k1    k7p(d)  k2                    k1   k7p(o)     k2   
                The above is an example of frequently occuring in text
               -Some desirable arguments on surface level sound odd (hamAre aXyApaka kakSA meM (odd) kaTina aXyAya ko xoharAwe hEM)
	       -Meaning can be ambiguous without it (vaha padZawe paDZawe atakawA hEM; vaha atakawA hEM--> this is ambiguous)
               -Some of them take mandatory arguments as different roles. For that purpose i hav kept them as desirable instead of mandatory like k7t, rh, vmod etc,.
                A verb can take any of these as mandatory arg. Because of this confusion i hav kept them under desirable.

mandatory (m): -not required for verb but still sentence will be incomplete without it--> bottle me ek litre pani aata hai --> k7
               -sentence is proper when u drop this arg but it is required by the verb--> mk1
               
Vibhaktis:	-multiple vibhaktis clubbed together are taken by the single verb for which the frame is made or also by the verbs that are its synonyms 

Populated:	Verb is already present with a particular sense but one of its frame is not made. So the verb is populated again for that frame. 
                Then this should not be considered as populated. Its frame is populated.
